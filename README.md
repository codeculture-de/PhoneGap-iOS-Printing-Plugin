PhoneGap-iOS-Printing-Plugin
================================================

PhoneGap iOS plugin for printing via Air Print. Remake of [this](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/iOS/PrintPlugin) plugin (I think the repo is dead now. The plugin works with PhoneGap 3.0+ and ARC.

#Installing the plugin

Copy Print.h and Print.m files to your Plugins folder and Print.js file to 'www/js/plugins' folder.

Add js file to your index.html.

    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/plugins/Print.js"></script>

Then add the following code to your config.xml:

        <feature name="Print">
                <param name="ios-package" value="Print" />
                <param name="onload" value="true" />
        </feature>

#Using the plugin
Signature:

    Print.print(html, isPdf, filePath, successCallback, failCallback)

- Html can be null or docuemnt to print
- isPdf false by default. Need to set true if you want to print a pdf
- filePath - string url to a pdf file

For adding new html conten that needs to be printed do the following:

        var html = <h1>Your html content</h1>;
    Print.print( html, function(result) {
                alert("Printing successful"); }, 
        function(result) {
            if (!result.available) { 
                alert("Printing is not available");
            } else {
                alert(result.error);
            }
    });

Before printing you might want to check the feature's availability:

    Print.isPrintingAvailable( function(result) {
        alert(result.available);
    });

isPrintingAvailable method will return object "{ available: true }" if the printing is working on the device. In other case it will return false;
